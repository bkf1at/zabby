		<h4>Skydive in Florida</h4>
			<p>It was my birthday and I wanted to skydive for the sake of it. I roadtripped to Florida and skydived the next day. The skydive was so short-lived but it was a refreshing experience. For the few seconds when we dived, I could not breath and I became scared. Wind was blowing at all directions and it was difficult to maintain a normal breath but I immediately opened my mouth for more air. The fall was very beautiful, overlooking the skies like a bird and he pulled the parachute. The parachute ride is what I enjoyed most and it was so slow and exhilirating. They include the option for a videographer. Till I watched the videos, I did not see how scary it was. We jumped from 17000 feet high.</p>

		<h4>Disney Animal Kingdom</h4>
			<p>The next day after the skydive, I went to Disney, Animal Kingdom. Apparently I did not know DisneyLand is a whole city in itself. The place has a very large area that includes resorts, car parks,roads with traffic lights and bus stop areas and all the 4 parks. I thought it was just a park when you enter to it and exit. I did not know it had divisions and practically built like a town! It is really a big attraction indeed. At the Animal Kingdom, the have almost all the continents. They have built the places to look like Africa, Asia among others.</p>

		<h4>Cruise to Bahamas from Florida</h4>
			<p>The Carnival Cruise line is what my cousins and I boarded to the islands of Bahamas. Boarding the cruise was more or less like the process of flying to a different country. I did not know it was going to be so detailed like that. We had an ocean view and it was very beautiful when the sun sets and at night with all the stars. In Bahamas, the natives look primarily like Africans. The island basically relies on tourism. There were about five cruise ships docked.</p>

		<h4>Idaho</h4>
			<p>My brother lives in Idaho I have been there 3 times, despite how far way it is from New York and Georgia. Idaho is a very small city, it is largely populated during the university school year. It is mostly cold.  My first visit was in winter and it could snow up to the doorstep eventhough the building had a staircase. It was also my first time seeing snow!</p>

		<h4>New York</h4>
			<p>The first time I came to the United States, I landed in New York. It made me remember the song by Alicia Keys and Jay Z, called Empire State of Mind. It is such a descriptive song about New York. In Times Square, the steets never sleeps, there is a lot of diversity which I was not expecting. We took a boat along the Statue of Liberty and it was nice. New York is so congested but lovely because every culture, personality, ethnicity and race is accepted.</p>
